/*
Self Implemented Vector needs to have the following properties:
1. maintain the primitive array
2. Big-Five to provide deep-copy for copy constructor and operator=
3. TheVectorwillprovidearesizeroutinethatwillchange(generallytoalargernumber) the size of the Vector and a reserve routine that will change (generally to a larger number) the capacity of the Vector.

4. Implemntation of operator []
5. size(), empty(), clear(), back(), push_back(), pop_back()
6. The Vector will provide support for the nested types iterator and   	const_iterator, and associated begin and end methods.
